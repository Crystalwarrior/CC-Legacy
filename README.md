# CC-Legacy

A legacy build of my murder mystery roleplaying project built in Godot 3.1. The git repository for the project was incredibly messy and kept swapping styles wholesale, so I decided to publish the original 2D iteration as a repository.
Feel free to add upon and expand on the project. There's no guarantees on it being functional.
